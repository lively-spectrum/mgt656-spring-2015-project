<h2>Work completed</h2>
After meeting with Miles and Olivia, Eric finally got a better handle on this git thing. He removed old events from the homepage and took care of the event details. Frustratingly, the test for "should reject RSVPs from non-Yale addresses" timesout. Only two days ago, it passed--and Olivia saw it! Still not sure why it's not working anymore. The page shows 

Elaine took care of all of the errors that should be displayed. She also has been trying to finish other stories related to events, and at the same time trying to understand what was wrong with the update not showing up on Heroku. Elaine has added in pictures and texts on the about us page and homepage, but having problem merging branch to master, and updating to heroku either. The two of us will go through the relevant tutorial once more and fix the gulp/mocha function before the weekend so that we can work more on the other core stories.

Yoni worked on the CSS. He also took the lead on making sure we had all of our bases covered for the final sprint. In a last-second moment of inspiration and perseverance, he discovered an "errors" that was spelled "errros." Boom. When we think of Yoni, we think "eros." But that's a different story...


<h2>Burndown Chart</h2>



<p>The green trend line shows the expected story points burndown, while the yellow line shows the actual points finished. We are behind our expectations as we struggled through the merge issue. We are expecting to get back on track by the end of the week.</p>


<h2>Backlog: </h2>


<h2>Work to be done next</h2>

<p>Eric will continue his work on event detail page/create new event page-make each event clickable title, etc; Once fix the push problem, Elaine will focus on new event page/RSVP-add attendee registration form; Yoni will take a lead in making the website actually look good by further editing CSS.</p>
